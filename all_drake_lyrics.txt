You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost
I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say
[Drake]
Yeah

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

You the da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had

Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one they never get confused wit
'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You the da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you da fuckin'
Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You the da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
Uh, ah yeah
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young money, yeah yeah
You know who you are, I got you


[Drake Talking]
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man.
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to uh
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her one of my most recent addition to my collection of female disappointments you know
[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes u Ant Viv
Until u take from me till the point that u can't give.
And when I see u out I pass by it's offensive
But what u expect tho
Kinda direct yo
Cuhz all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy that tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cuz Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Speaking]
let me see what im gonna say for the second one yeah i got it hold on uh
[Verse 2:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that ya'll believe in
Cuhz when I say I'm serious you claim u only Teasin
I plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple of years i guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready to love and leave her drama
Cuhz I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losin a feeling
U losin appealing
U need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Verse 3:]
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But u was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
Sayin to my self u deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
And fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me u ain't cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
How u think cuddling with its cute
They laugh at how u think u last when u really don't
And make u think u get the ass when u really wont
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a pre-nup and in initials
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
[Hook:]
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Drake: talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
Slacker It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter its just its life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
ha ha ha you know what it is man
its drake,slacker,dilla rest in peace
These girls ain't got nothin' on you
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you are pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you nothin' on you
Aint got nothing on ya,
They ain't got nothing on ya
Killer killer
Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't
Girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't
That boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And put you in the louboutins,
What you want
What you need
I can be
Your everything
Them other niggas
Just wanna hit it but if they had it
Wouldn't know what to do with it
(and together)
We shut it down down down down
They know we shut it down down down
Your the baddest girl around round round
They notice, they notice
We shut it down down down down
You would shut it down down down
Til you finally come around round round
They notice, they notice
Shut it down
T-M-Z, concrete 'oop
You shut that shut that down down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that shut that down down down
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets.
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine, but she don't have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down, girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found The One?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down
You shut that shit down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it, oh
They notice, they notice
You lookin' good girl
Go go go get 'em girl,
Go go go go hit 'em girl
Go go go go go go
You lookin' good girl
Go go go get 'em girl,
Go go go go hit 'em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down
The way I'm feelin'
Things I say
All just happen
When you pass my way
What can I do
To make you stay?
I know it's gettin' late
But girl I don't want you to leave
You tell me you're just not the type
You wanna do this right
And I'm not tryna say I don't believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed
And if you feel the same
This wait ain't really make us better people
Take those fuckin' heels off, it's worth it girl
Nothin' is what I can picture you in
So take that fuckin' dress off, I swear you won't forget me
You'll be happy that you let me lay you down down down
I'm tryna lay you down down down
You still the baddest girl around round round
They notice they notice
Let me lay you down down down
Tryna lay you down down down
You still the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, young money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
This for shorty up on glen grove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
As hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself?
If we may we'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all
Are having the same fears, shedding similar tears
And of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought
Uh
Uh huh, uh huh
Look
(Drake: Verse 1)
I let the beat bang
I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy
(Drake chorus)
Uh
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin
Killa
Killa
Killa
Killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
I'm a.
Killa
Killa
(Look)
Killa
Killa nigga
(Listen, look)
(Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)
Before rap,
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind
'Cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time
Hussle
"Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R; men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow"
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh, look, fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil' bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway 3 months later I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's something to do, yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dog
Verse 1:
(check)
they ask me bout this rapper chick i might know i say i never hit but we sure to try it right though my verses smuther beats and they are in need of some lipo as for rappers she is not my type she's like a typo flow is universal take a blood test im type O naz do me a favor turn da volume up its quite low i write so i might blow my chain im into white glow see life as a scrimage and i am runnin the iso wat is about to unfold no tellin like a dice throw meet alot a chicks so your girl is someone i might know thats only if she's nice though i aint about the whife though and let no uncle ben's rice throw that is just how my life goesss and move faster then a leoperd sprint round the world got alot of spots like leopard print i use to think u play to much but i rather go deaf then lose touch
(holla at me baby)
chorus:

(let me give you my new shit x7)
call me any time i bet you ill be around
Verse 2:

[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn!
That punch line was predictable
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull
And we don't need new members
To me the clique is full
And I be gettin' the same women that tip the pool
Believe or not
I receive a lot
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buyin' the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock
This shit is easy Pop
That's why I'm ready, man
I'd never copy Norbit like Eddie, man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head?
Did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playin' streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see y'all
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall
Yep!
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?
[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chillin'
Super low key
If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.
All the hustlers and the bouncers
And the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades
In a group with no kids
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got alota dough
Plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain't heard?
I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison
They takin' too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
'Cause I make 'em feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold
Just remember where I lived at, 50 thousands goin' gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man
You actin' like a bitch
I ain't actin' like I'm rude
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich
Yeah, uh!
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?
'Cause I don't waste time, can't you see a nigga lazy?
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
No, ain't no nigga like me
Ya dig?
[Spoken: Lil' Wayne]
Y.M., bitch!
Everybody!
Two time on Sunday!
Spit 'em!
Check ya blinkers, baby!
Check ya blinkers, baby!
'Cause, to me, look like you've been turning right all day! Yeah!
Right my way! Ha ha!
I got a boulevard, baby!
That's right!
Cash Avenue!
Wall Street gangsta!
Carter, y'all! Heh heh!
Why would I lie?
Yeah!
I ain't rich, bitch, I'm wealthy!
Young! I talk shit 'til I die!
Come kill me, nigga!
Fuck you!
No homo!
She like it! Heh ha ha!
Yeah!
Boy, these mothafuckin' glasses I got on right now, are so mothafuckin' cold!
[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
I'm feelin' like...
Damn!
I done walked in here
Straight up lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me
'Cause, ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga
Ain't no nigga like a young money nigga
Damn!
I done walked in here
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year
My shades so dark
And my ice so bright
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right...
Im tryin do it all tonight,
I got plans,
I got a certain lust for life,
And as it stands,
Everything is going as right,
As it can,
They tryin to shoot down my flight,
Before it lands,
Before it lands,
But you could miss me with all that,
Diss me then crawl back,
I really wish ya'll will fall back,
But gettin rich suppose to slove that,
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say,
No no no,
My ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let,
Go go go
She in love,
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with us,
Let them girls in for a drink,
And Im all in they ear,
Saying she should be the one I see,
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here?
Black surburban wit the tent on it,
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it,
The game got these old hand prints on it,
But ima be the one to pour cement on it,
And start over,
And show up in a Margiela tux,
I dont really give a fuck,
And we only getting older,
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past,
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last,
You just hope that it last,
that it last,
that it last,
that it last,
that it last,
......
......
......
......
Throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up in the air for her,
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
(Rr' Ting) I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone boy
Get hurt boy
Aw here go another mo'fucker
That don't understand the concept of puttin' money first boy (first)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work boy (work)
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know, ah
That's the worst boy (worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been a man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches (what you worried 'bout)
I got one girl, and she my girl
And nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit boy
Phone call back home
Shit is hot up in the 6 boy (hot up in the 6 boy)
Shit hot up in the 6 right now shit
Hot up in the 6 boy (hot up in the 6 boy)
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed boy
Black Benz on the road boy
Already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad boy
I give a fuck about your mob boy
I'm the real 6 God boy
I'm about to say a true thing

You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain

It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city a way right now
Yeah so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
Versace Versace I brought that shit back all these niggas they copy
medusa head on me like im luminati
my penis is big and my balls sag low
everyone who ask to see It they do
if u a nigga I got u too
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
that we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
[Drake and Woman on phone]
"Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
"Are you drunk right now?" -- Woman
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
[Drake on phone]
"You're not going to come?"
"Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then..."
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble

It's like o nine in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you're sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
It's like o six in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real, is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, she
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's goin' through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't where I'd really be without that,
It worked out man, you deserve it
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out, and you need some, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
[Drake]
My name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
but i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint on the fence about it
i aint mistah feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamor
who dress like Sarah Jessica
and live like princess Diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truly you're bad enough that you don't even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i don't really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin
Chorus x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
[Wayne]
My name is weezy
I'm almost perfect
and i work harder than hard workin
bizarre circus
that's where my bar surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im laying on my back
im never backin down
so overstand me
i got a condo in Miami
and my doormat is always sandy
and i run Louisiana
but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in Atlanta
and i always wear a bandannie
and when it comes down to stuntin
you boys is just buntin and
im swinging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl sanging to my shit
like ah loli loli pop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
she say i get that pussy better
better than her gynecologist
hoe just text me
everybody want some mo dick mo dick
old bitch
young bitch
but i be like damnnnn
all i got is one dick
Chorus
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
[Santogold]
I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place,
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race
Chorus x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
ey ey ey ey
you don't lie
ey ey ey ey
you don't lie
[Verse 1: drake]
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I can't believe we're finished
My life is movin' fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I can't put this behind me
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could've had my all by now, by now
It's been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question
[Hook]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
[Verse 2: dawn richard]
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you would've called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...
[Hook]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
[Verse 3: drake]
I can't go to bed
Thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a u-haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out
[Hook]
I wonder whatever became of you
Although, it's not that I'm surprised, it's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it
Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' at the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take a third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all
Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
Got some problems with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it
Drank in my cup, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition
And that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit
And all these verses that I kill
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflage down
Put your camera phone down
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever
That's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia
She 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribo
And do 'em both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital
She love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side
Twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow
I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh
Shoutout to all of my hoes
Tunechi
That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz
But the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all
Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it
Well if you know like I know
That pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead
That pussy like a pothole
I'm colder than the snot nose
Man all these hoes is my hoes
and if she bougie fuck her once
then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend
Don't cross that line its paper thin
High as a star, make a wish
I'm a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch
You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you're riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all
Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no 'cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now
Me time
[Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
when you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more,
[Chorus]
Loving you no more,
i just i cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2)
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
so many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
but never her approval no matter how I try,
the way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
momma always told me to respect the woman,
but what am I to do when her parents do not try,
So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing I'm afraid to say,
oooooohhh
[Chorus]
I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
punishment for me is trying to let go,
give it from your heart is what you taught me,
addiction to pain is what it got me,
my life, now its changed,
my life aint the same as you are,
heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
if I can't have what mean most to me,
So many tears I cried,
but all for nothing I'm afraid to say,
[Chorus]
[Drake]
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure
[Chorus]
[End]
My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes, I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma though
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first
These bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches I keep em' comin'
I pull up right now I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You don't come around here 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that cock trip
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got big with my bag with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she lash on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom, we did it
I see how they countin' this out
Bet they ain't never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin, I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I bought up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga do you really mean it
When I was sleepin' on the floor you shoulda seen how they treat me
I pour the Actavis and pop pills so I can fight the demons
I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma though
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
if you get hit you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again
I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on a Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple
what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know it's a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil' Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas
that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
I did the digital dash
I fuck the bitch on the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to lil' mama though
Yeah
I know we just signed a deal but
I need my advance on the next one too, they know I'mma be around
Yea

Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears still falling down on my last bitch
This money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen stars lining up you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha, ha
Cuban links hanging on my wrist I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look around see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked outside Buford County came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean I ain't even started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean my niggas still there
Just imagine you was living lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches I just paid they bills now
Money make 'em feel good, but does she make me feel good
Known for gettin' that guala out in Europe, but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a motherfucker like I'm on my last damn dollar
Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch

Swear to God I'll buy this motherfucker ah

Sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been
Sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing

I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin' you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you could vouch for me
I put the cocaine in the powder in the couch homie
Whenever I step outside the house I keep that glockie on me
Bad bitches wanna come buy the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely wanna
I'm barely paying attention, baby I need substance
I know you spend some time putting your makeup and your outfit but

For me to move on and succeed

Jealousy, envy and greed

I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out of trenches, I really made it

Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it

Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo
The clip got a whole lot of 30
I got my clique and they represent this
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like a nigga wearin' jerseys
Like we love wearin' jerseys
Crime rate's goin' crazy, crazy
Cause my young niggas so thirsty
Couple commas, made a purchase
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
Caught the wave, I ain't surfin'
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you got it
You do what you want when you poppin'
You do what you want when you got it
[Refrain: Future]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us
[Verse 1: Future]
Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out the Bentley and roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I'm keepin' the bank, I'm like Bird
Sip out my cup and it's dirty
[Hook: Future]
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
First I got married to money
Then I fell in love with that dirty
Extendo, extendo, extendo

You do what you want when you got it

[Verse 2: Future]
I like the smell of that money when it burn
Bitch you know a nigga poppin', wait your turn
I make some more money, it's got me delirious
When your gang gangs in the chain gang, this shit serious
I got a main ting, that's a period
I rep the same gang on account of of my niggas
We fill up two planes on account of these riches
I fuck up some loose change on account of these bitches
[Refrain]
I be on syrup, they know it
Stack up some money then blow it
I do what I want and I spazz
Take the styrofoam, pour the syrup up
It's a dress code but it ain't for us
[Hook: Future]

[Verse: Drake]
Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids'll lose their lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga, out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need it 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you, now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you that they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champÃº, young pablito de sies dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off, well ain't I?
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know
Yeah
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a motherfuckin' legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin'
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I'm up first, I'm on tour
Got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas
Now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know if I die I'm a motherfuckin' legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin'
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know wassup, ay
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know if I die I'm a motherfuckin' legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin'
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
I'm the one

Sauga city trip the pay day
Load up off a gate way, man you can't afford me
Doing is one thing
Doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid
Young nigga preach (preach)
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'mma finally, finally (yeah, yeah)
Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night
Girl I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet
Girl I'm lonely
That shit ain't my fault girl 'cause I'm lonely
Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should come for me when I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
Heard you spend your summers in Miami
At somebody's house
That you didn't buy
You're young, yeah, have fun girl, but I hope it was worth it
'Cause fuck it, I'm not here to judge
Fuck it I'm not here to love
Everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell I ring
You and I got options bae
But name another woman ain't no other woman
That should come for me when I'm lonely
Mix the Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I'm lonely, when I'm lonely
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man
Yeah
Yeah
Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 Man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm (Lou Will)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
Like Soulja, I thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Yeah
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work
Work the night shift
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing
I'm old, you gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly 'cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, this not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Yeah
Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work
Work the night shift

I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
Something is said, don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that thing

Just let me go, let me bring it home
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
I see you doin' well, baby
Oh you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything
Hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now
It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?
Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said "I heard you back with you know who
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"
And she like "Who are we kidding
You're 27 you just being you
You're your father's child, man thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I don't pretend with this momma
I'on joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma
I'm " Home Alone" with it momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
It's just they cloning me momma
Them niggas wannabes momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma
I'm not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I don't call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life
[Hook: Gabriel GarzÃ³n Montano sample]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
[Verse 1]
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my
[Hook: Gabriel GarzÃ³n Montano sample]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
[Verse 2]
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?
[Hook: Gabriel GarzÃ³n Montano sample]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do
[Verse 3]
These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
[Outro: Gabriel GarzÃ³n Montano sample]
Rock me real slowly (x2)
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
Rock, rock
Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual
So I guess it's understandable man
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
"That's the shit I'm talking about though, like
You changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more,
You just dash me away like a cyattie.
Yo, you cheesed me dog."
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the Bar exam, I drove in the snow for you?
Yeah you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl, how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)
Oh you thought you had it all figured back then girl, how 'bout now
'Cause I'm right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)
Yeah you thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl, how 'bout now?
Yeah, girl how 'bout now
How 'bout now girl, what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now
Yeah always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CD's of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but
[Intro]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like
Fo real
This life shit, is everywhere you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much
You, you, you
Baby wanna take it down, throw it up
Baby wanna take it down, throw it up
I'll take it down
[Hook 1]
Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it, this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl
We can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw, man
[Verse]
Me and you are playing house, tart think that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women, cuz you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I just get lost up in the 6
[Hook 2]
And you never come to where stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situation can get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw man, aw man
Aw man
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, young money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
I don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
This for shorty up on glen grove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
As hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself?
If we may we'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all
Are having the same fears, shedding similar tears
And of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it
I can't help it
I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me
Stop pretendin', stop that frontin'
I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger
Girl you know I seen ya naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay remniscin'
And makeup sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl
And you might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low
Mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low
Smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low
Schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect
Like everyone I know
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin', schemin'
Plottin', schemin', getting money
This the life for me
My mama told me this was right for me
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rapping different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly the boy
I just build and build more
Y'all niggas build and destroy
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to, yeah
This the shit I wanna go out to
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
And we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure
How you feel about, coming home with a, nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's about who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, that's for sure
Own It
It's yours
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is?
It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend
Guess who's it is?
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?
It's yours
Own it
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go own that shit
Own it
I said go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, go own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit, own that shit
Go own that shit
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline
You should call it
When the last time you did something for the first time?
You have done it all, swear to God
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours
Own it
It's yours, yeah
It's yours, own it
Own It
Own It
Own It
Own It
Baby, own it
It's yours
Own that shit, own that shit
Own that shit
Worst
Mufucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playin' my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions
Nigga we don't know shit
Flexin', nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you
I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see 'em all finish
[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us, remember?
Mufucka never loved us, remember?
Mufucka, remember?
Mufucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Mufuckas never loved us
Man, mufuckas never loved us
Worst behavior
Mufuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Worst behavior
[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mufuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mufucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mufucka, I done grown up
You know me, you know me
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B.
[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us, remember?
Mufucka never loved us, remember?
Mufucka, remember?
Mufucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Mufuckas never loved us
Man, mufuckas never loved us
Worst behavior
Mufuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Worst behavior
[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks, who else makin' rap albums
Doing numbers like it's pop? Same old pimp
Drake you know ain't nothing changed with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A. open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
[Outro]
Remember?
Remember?
Mufucka
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Mufucka never loved us
Remember?
Mufucka
Remember?
Worst behavior
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
"Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting,
Scarborough ting from time, G,
Been have up di ting dem from time, G.
So I don't know what's wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh,
Y'all need to know yourself."
I got my eyes on you,
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you,
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home, ho oh
I got my eyes on you,
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you,
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion, endlessly

You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it

So just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
Just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
Ho oh (goin' home)

Gave you every
Thing I love
I think there's something
Baby

Baby
You're the girl,
You're the one
Gave you every
Thing I love

You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it

Oh just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
Just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (goin' home)
Ho oh (goin' home)
(Hold on, hold on)
(Hold on)
Yeah, isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different" oh
Oh the idea's fun
Oh the idea's fun
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swangin'
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume 'cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe, yeah swangin' eh
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler and I'd allow her,
Talk about pussy power
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
'Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way around
Swangin', eyes closed just swangin'
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swangin' eh
Don't talk to me like I'm famous eh
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe I'll be here just swangin'
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east and
Exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late 'cause this nigga's creepin' and I like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'
I treat you good girl like you're famous
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl
I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talking that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country and then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language, now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Drop down, drop-drop
Shit is real out here
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop-drop down, drop-drop, get it
Get it, drop down, drop-drop
Ooh, 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you, I'm with it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
Get it, I get it
They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it!
I get it, I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Now shit down in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man is sparklin' enough for you?
Ooh, 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get i
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you, I'm with it
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it
Get it, I get it
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it, I get it you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it, you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents sayin' this another phase in your life they can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm workin' too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it, I get it, what's up for the night?
Ooh, 305 to my city
I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We just did it, we did it
We did it, we did it
We so far from finished I brought you right back just so we can relive it
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
"Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R; men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow"
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh, look, fuck all that happy to be here shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil' bro me dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and I say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin' different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same, man, I'm doin' it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway 3 months later I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's something to do, yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dog

[Verse 1]
They say that all of yo old girls got somebody new
I say, "damn really? even Rosemary? even Leanne Seely?"
They said, "fuckin right, they were the 1st to go
Its nothing personal
it's just that all of them women you slept on were working though,
they was saving up
New niggas came around, they've been waking up with,
I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might've loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing
They don't know you.."
Sure they do they're just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "why you even give a fuck you not even here"
Well out there there ain't nothing for me, and I think I need to come home,
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
[Verse 2]
I be with my nigga chubbs
he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double cheek kiss
Along for that ignorant Young Money, Miami beach shit
A couple of artists got words for me , that's never fun
They say its on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change,
by a nigga named tip when my deal came
Told me its all good, even when it feels strange
Now I'm the guy that know strippers by they real names
Rochelle, Jordanne, thick bitches, they just talked me out of 4 grand
How did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it?
And now I'm living a muthafuckin fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yea, just lie to my ears,
tell me it feel the same, its all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low, and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever,
that's why I gotta come home,
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
[Verse 3]
My mother is back to who she was years ago
Its like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she stopped checking up on women I cant stand
'cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'll never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names, that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say, "wat up tho"
I used to brag about it to my friends, and now Im feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe thats all they do, is just pretend, damn
But I bought it though, I believed it
Yea, I thought it, and I achieved it
Yea, so show me love, show me fucking love!
'cause I thought it was all I needed
Yea, Clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this will be the year that I wont even feel shit
They trip about the amount of people I brought along
But Im just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for everyone of these Toronto kids
I promise they see it with me, we just tryna live
I told 'em we bout to get it, and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit I swear it sounded like home
[Chorus]
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where,
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
[Outro - Bob Marley]
[End]
I'm the f***in' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, New York City b****
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, f***in' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't s*** changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pa** it like a relay"
YMCMB you n****s more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm f***in' with her, I don't really need her
Ahhh, That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these b****es wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real n**** wassap
Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto n**** YOLO
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, n**** we don't really play
Every day, every day, f*** what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real n**** wassup?
One, time f*** one time
I'm calling n****s out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her p**** so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this b****
Wish a n**** would like a tree in this b****
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that b****
That's my MO add a B to that s***
I'm f***ed up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
N**** money talks and Mr Ed! Ya
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't s*** sweet n****s on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God Becky look at her butt
Tunechi
Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto n**** YOLO
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, n**** we don't really play

Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real n**** wassup?
Wassap wassap

Every day, every day, f*** what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real n**** wassup?
Wassap, wassap
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a f*** and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this s***, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it, cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
F*** them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,
Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new s*** that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these n****s sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know the game even got it like that
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my s*** and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
F*** them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell a bad bitch girl, lets go hang

Fuck my young niggas, XO gang
Get so drunk you forget yo name
Incense, burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range, Im taking off when that light change
Im Drizzy Drake to my old bitches, Voodoo child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back, So Im all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows 'n screw flows, my shit be sounding like great taste now
Lemme go and hit that cup, 1 time before a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give anything that make shit go slow
Yea, money in my safe, but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change, but I don't really see no change in us, oh no
[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know its real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know its real
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it
'Cause when Im not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate with my Porsche
Its simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffin' purple hash welcome to my power circle
Sucker free no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rollin', rose gold rollie's
NBA accountants, amounts they get unholy
But mama still praying for her rubberband man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker drums playin'
Tap dance to my drum roll, I love a bitch that know to keep me one rolled
[Hook: Drake]
Tat my name on you so I know its real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know its real
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it
'Cause when Im not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
[Verse 3: Drake]
I dont have to work in the morning so I always stay for 1 more
fuck what they say, Im telling you theres no side effects Im sure
Went from driving up on some old shit, to drivers opening doors
This is my town, if you need something just ask for its yours
Yea, ask for its yours, if you ask for it its done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they're all playing their role, Put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man I cant say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they cant say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I give everybody a piece of this, and I make due whats left
Yea I do this shit to the death, yea I do this shit till Im gone
yea, I told you that its our world, and you foolish thinking Im wrong
Stop asking how the fucking needle feel
Tat my fucking name on you, let these niggas know its real, wassup
[Hook]
Tat my name on you so I know its real
Tat my fucking name on you so I know its real
I know it hurts, But I aint tryna hear it
'Cause when Im not around, I'll still be there in spirit
You'll still be mine, yea, you'll still be mine
Tat my fucking name on you, when I go you'll still be mine, yea
You'll still be mine, yea, I'll still be yours
Tat my fucking name on you, let em know you love the boy, wassup
[End]

[Drake - Chorus]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
F-ck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So your the only one
Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooo oooo oooo ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Uh
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
ooooh ooooh trust issues

Hello, yeah I just walked in, yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now? 'Did I go out' yeah I went out, I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit' wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy wit a good guy
But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around oh
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well I'm sorry"
"Are you drunk right now?"
I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me
"You're not going to come?"
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then"
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble
[Verse 1: Drake]
The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands are safe
There safe
Just in a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through
Had some more that I give for you
And I only fuck you like that on your birthday
Although baby I just landed
Out to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Wont hurt just some turbulence with draw babe
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
Ill keep you safe, so safe[Verse 2: Drake]
Less than a minute take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through
Had some more that I give for you
And I only fuck you like that on your birthday
Although baby I just landed
Out to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
[Drake - Verse 1]
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeh, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell em I love em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates I send the Maybach out the neighbourhoods, they never seen it
That shit is dangerous but it so convenient
I aint lying, yeah
And comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italian, some fly shit
It's sittin' at the house like I bought it in '9-6
Cause honestly I'm too f-cking busy to drive stick
I swear, too f-cking busy, too busy f-cking
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me
Preheated oven, I'm in this so
But I aint finished though
It's been a minute though
My newest girl back home, got issues with parents
And some charges, how the f-ck can I get her to Paris
Luckilly, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled surprised I wasn't surprised
Thats only cause I been waitin' on it, nigga
So f-ck whoever hatin on a nigga
Of course
Don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Dont, don't f-ck with me, don't f-ck with me
Don't
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympia's
We talked music for hours she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga so far these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ohh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Shit I seen it, you just aint inside
And I feel like lately I went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive
And they tryna bring us down me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage, dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, it wasnt a lie
Yeah, just have some good p-ssy waiting on a nigga
And f-ck whoever hatin' on a nigga
I like that pusyy but the pussy hate me cause i be leavin im just a playa
can tell that money's got you working
We've been talking for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret, in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up
Call me Big Daddy won't you back that ass up
Girl who is you playing with, back that ass up
You working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Girl you working with some ass yeah, you bad yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash yeah, his last yeah
Hoes frown when you pass yeah, they mad yeah
Couple thousand on your bag yeah, fuck yeah., fuck me just like that yeah.
[Intro]
Yeah
This songs from old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit
For my niggas, though
[Verse 1]
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldnt lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, cant hear em over the laughter
Yeah, thats cause Im headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, Im just being Frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she aint with you
Wildin, doin shit thats way out of your budget
Owl sweaters and saddle luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
Thats why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight white pre?, whys it always me
Got us watchin our words like theres wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin to help
[Verse 2]
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press over the summer for allegations
I aint lyin, my nigga, my time is money
Thats why I aint got time for a nigga whos time is comin
A lot of niggas PR stuntin like thats the movement
And Im the only nigga still know for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everythings lookin gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit, theres a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like quarters off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like Im seated at Swiss?
Nothin was the same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
We do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheel
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to poppy, might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the screwface, livin out a suitcase
But Im feelin good, Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
Its funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like Ive been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
Im on my King James shit, Im tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin to win here again
Man, whats up
[Outro]
Yeah
A young nigga tryin to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city Im in
I got her drinkin with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeah

Wassup, real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money, you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sounds so tough
So and so just walked on, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance, girl
I already tried with a lot of these niggas
Fuck that, that team don't know real, what's that?
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believe in, is the best shit fo the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That that top row of veneer
Just when they getting impatient
When I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word, award shows coming
Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure they give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us make that shit into a song
Ya ain't livin' that boy stop stealin' that life
Anything could happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depends on how I'm feelin' that night
Okay, live my life in hotels
Bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ah, this is perfect for the women that I love before
I love em all, I just love me more
I could bet all of the riches that I ever have
Rush in the night like a shock-wave wouldn't be bad
If I had to? cause of the? that run up my back
You must? nothing else can leave me of track
Hey, yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me rising high
You're innocence, who's the brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime if you don't, you'll despair
By the throat
I could bet all of the riches that I ever have

My man looking up to me, he 'bout to sneeze
And she treating me like I be New Year's Eve
Counting down the seconds untill she sees me (5, 4, 3, 2)
One time for the women that wound up with Megan Fox
Two times for the ladies that never use Photoshop

My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried bout if my butt's fake
Worried 'bout John's singing us Drake
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dealing with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em, tell 'em blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm the first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly, I mean
She say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
That's right I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
So thick that everyone else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, and I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it
Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Holly Groove, the holy Mecca
Accountant say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girl from a Bida if she wave
Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang take the B, I'll behave ya
I'm niggas is for reals
If you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Now you see me, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To police pour me a drink and celebrate with me
Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
Moment of honesty
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be"
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now)
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
Why give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
If you ask me I'm ready
Hell yeaa !!!!
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
She got that good, good, she Michael Jackson Bad
I'm attracted to her for her attractive ass
And now we murderers because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave
I like the way you walk and if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place with all kind of space
I let you be the judge and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder 'cause she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bag
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you
Baby, my room is the G spot, call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he probably right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, me on my pedal bike
He on my low scrunch, he on my echo whites
He say, "Nikki, don't stop, you the bestest"
And I just be coming off the top as bestest
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, shake and bake Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen 'em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you
Baby, my room is the G spot, call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romancing, I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscious is
She watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show end, she all on my skin
Lotion, slow motion, roller coasting like back forth, hold it
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said, "Don't you ever show this"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless, when I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment
Uh, she ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, I mean flawless, well, that's what you are
How I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look it how she walk, she know she bad
Do, do your thing, baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't even fast, I'ma stay a while
Hold yo' head Chris, I'ma take her down
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you
Baby, my room is the G spot, call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you
Baby, my room is the G spot, call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
Fuckk itt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I fly with the stars in the skies,
I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,
And I will retire with the crown, yes!
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me!
But I couldn't do it all alone, we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't phase me
Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything that they deprived me of
Put ya drinks up,
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive (yeah, yeah, yeah uh)
What I tell 'em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz
Doin' target practice all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the C.E.O. five hundred degrees
Shout out to the O.V.O wear rings and fatigues, ow!
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be ya'll year we ain't get the memo
A young King, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is,
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah!
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life
This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell its time
Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Drake]

You should print the lyrics out and have a fucking read-along
Ain't a fucking sing-along unless you brought the weed along
Then ju.. (Okay, okay, okay)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talking, I beast
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah hoe this the finale

Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this di*k
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
Aka Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to a par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back I'll do ya, beast

....darling your dreams have been richer
[?] on my knees and I'm wishing
You work hard, I'll see you when I'm rich
You would think about how far from you I'm gon' get
I go hard around you always
You give me something that I've never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you'll never leave
Just get rich and work, work, work
Work, work, work
[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done
Gotta work come over
We just need that slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know that we need to get done, done, done, done
And you come over
Sorry if I'm way less...
I got a lot on my shoulders
Listen to me cause I'm older
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
I could bet all the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If I had to set the alarm
'Cause those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else can lead me off track
Hey, yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me rising high
You're innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime if you don't,
You'll despair, by the throat
I could bet all the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
Hey, yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me rising high
You're innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime if you don't,
You'll despair, by the throat
You're innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?
It's a crime if you don't,
You'll despair, by the throat
Hey, yeah
You're like a wildfire
Got me rising high
You're innocence, who's brave?
Drowning in, would you save me?

[J. Cole]
Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
Im trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, Im wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a n-gga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but sh-t, I might get high with you
Its only fitting cause Im looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So i threw em back, now all my n-ggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad n-gga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine
[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
[Drake]
Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink dat dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work, I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love big women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it
Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if..
[Chorus - Drake]
[J. Cole]
Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldnt judge a n-gga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin
And you know just what Im talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cooking n-gga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, thats just a warning
[Chorus]
[End]
Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
First off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
'Cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though, I'm so Sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan
I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'mma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all"
I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs"
I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'mma be a legend even when my life end
And I'mma be a legend even when this life end
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard, and I'mma go hard
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?
do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, 'cause I meant it
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
that I eat it in the morning
'Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum
put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
and born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi and Barbie you know
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ay
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?
Ba-ba-baby
This is something you should know, I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glow, watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out, barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ay
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ay
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ay
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's on sink, ay
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ay
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ay
Well he mad as fuck when they sex she scream for me, ay
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ay
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ay
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby girl, you can stay the night 'till the morn'
All this ice on my arm
What you like, what you want?
And I might put you on
Bitch, it's mine can't you see?
And I rock seventeen
All these knots in my jeans
Me and Zoo turnin' up
Got your boo in the cut
And she sue 'cause it's looking like the roof going up
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
'Cause baby you the baddest
All this money, I'mma cash it
And I'm swervin' all in traffic
While I'm trapping out the mansion
And I'm moving through the tri-state
Do two-hundred on the highway
And I'm swerving in my i8
Baby, you should come my way
Squad!
